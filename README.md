# SwiftUI Social Contributor App

![alt text](https://github.com/adamrushy/social-swiftui-app/blob/main/banner.png)

Learning SwiftUI can often be difficult or confusing and despite the many tutorials available it's often practice that will help with your learning.

## What is this repository?

The idea of the Social Contributor App is that anyone can contribute, and we don't have any direction or even idea on what we're building. The idea is that you will contribute something and then somebody else will contribute more.

We might end up building a brand new social bank, social media or chat forum or we might even build a game. The power is in your hands.

## How To Contribute?

- Fork the repository to your profile
- Clone the repository to your machine
- Install SwiftLint to your machine with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
   - `brew install swiftlint`
- Create a new branch
- Add some SwiftUI code ðŸ”¥
- Create a PR

We'll get this merged and then you need to pass the baton to somebody else. Use the Twitter template below to pass the baton:
